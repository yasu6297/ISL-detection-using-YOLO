# Indian Sign Language (ISL) Gesture Detection Using YOLO

This project aims to develop a real-time system for detecting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using the YOLO object detection framework. The system utilizes a webcam to capture live video feed, detect ISL gestures on the fly, and visually display them in real-time.

## Introduction

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a vital communication tool for the hearing and speech-impaired community in India. Despite its significance, there is a lack of widespread technological solutions that enable seamless communication between ISL users and the general population. This project focuses on developing a real-time ISL gesture detection system using the YOLO object detection algorithm, providing a streamlined tool for recognizing ISL gestures in dynamic environments.

## Features

- Real-time detection of Indian Sign Language gestures.
- Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for fast and accurate recognition.
- Continuous detection with webcam feed.
- Easy-to-use and deployable in real-world applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/isl-gesture-detection.git
cd isl-gesture-detection
```

### Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages

- `torch`
- `opencv-python`
- `pyttsx3`
- `ultralytics` (for YOLOv5 or YOLOv8)

## Usage

1. **Run the Detection Script**

   To start detecting ISL gestures using your webcam, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python detect_signs.py
   ```

2. **Exit the Detection**

   To exit the detection, press the `q` key.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the YOLO model consists of labeled images of Indian Sign Language gestures. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes around the hands and labeled with the corresponding gesture.

### Data Preparation

Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:

```
/dataset
    /train
        /images
        /labels
    /val
        /images
        /labels
    data.yaml
```

The `data.yaml` file should define the paths and class labels for training and validation.

## Training the Model

To train the YOLO model on your dataset:

1. **Edit the YAML Configuration**

   Update the `data.yaml` file with the correct paths to your dataset and class names.

2. **Train the Model**

   Run the following command to start training:

   ```bash
   python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
   ```

3. **Save the Model**

   After training, the model weights will be saved as `best.pt` and `last.pt` in the `runs/train/` directory.

## Model Deployment

To deploy the model for real-time ISL detection:

1. **Load the Model**

   Modify the `detect_signs.py` script to load your trained model:

   ```python
   model = YOLO('path_to_your_model.pt')
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Start the detection by running the script:

   ```bash
   python detect_signs.py
   ```

## Results and Findings

The system was evaluated in various environments and demonstrated high accuracy in detecting ISL gestures in real-time. The detection was robust and effective, making the system suitable for practical applications such as communication aids for the hearing and speech-impaired.

## Future Work

Future improvements to this project may include:

- Expanding the dataset to include more gestures.
- Improving model accuracy by integrating advanced deep learning techniques.
- Developing a user interface for easier interaction and customization.
